# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

This is a location to record all high-level architecture decisions in the cosmos.nix project.

This concept was lifted from the [tendermint project](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/tree/master/docs/architecture)

An ADR should provide:

- Context on the relevant goals and the current state
- Proposed changes to achieve the goals
- Summary of pros and cons
- References
- Changelog

Note the context/background should be written in the present tense.
